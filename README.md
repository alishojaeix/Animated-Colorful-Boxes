# Animated-Colorful-Boxes
This one-page website showcases interactive animations using JavaScript, allowing users to grow, shrink, change the color, and move a square box with button clicks. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it's a great example for beginners learning DOM manipulation and CSS transitions.

## Features

- **Grow Button**: Increases the size of the box.
- **Shrink Button**: Decreases the size of the box back to its original state.
- **Change Color Button**: Changes the background color of the box to a random color.
- **Move Button**: Animates the box to move horizontally across the screen.

## How It Works

1. The HTML structure includes a square div (`box`) and four buttons (`Grow`, `Shrink`, `Change Color`, and `Move`).
2. CSS styles define the initial appearance of the box and ensure smooth transitions for animations.
3. JavaScript adds event listeners to the buttons, allowing users to trigger animations by clicking on them.
